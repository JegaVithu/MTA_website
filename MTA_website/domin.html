            <p>During late years tourism has turned out to be one of the world's most intense ventures in terms of
              revenue creation. This Industry becoming more and stronger considering global economy which expanded with
              the increment of tourist arrival. From recent times Sri Lanka able to expand the tourist sector and able
              to attract foreign investors and local people who are interested in contributing. By being a tropic
              country, it helps to attract lot of European people who loves to enjoy the climate here in Sri Lanka.
              Also, the location and beauty of the country further help in attracting process of tourists which also
              encouraged by the ending of 30 years of war.</p>
            <p>Sri Lankan Economy is mostly depending on the Service Sector which is around 60% of entire the
              Production. So, government also very much interested in providing facilities and uplift the tourism
              sector to earn more and more profits. With the enlargement of tourist industry, it brings some common
              problems which require the attention of all of us. So, we come up with a solution to one such problem
              through this Research project. With the development of the technology it is easier for any tourist to
              access any location and get details of what they want.</p>
            <p>Nowadays' wireless networks like mobile phones, internet and numerous other new technologies together
              gives different functionalities which are significantly making impact on our day to day activities. In
              this manner mobile tourism spread rapidly among tourists which becomes a self-navigation to them. It
              not helps to tourist other than hotel owners and trip.</p>
            <p>The System covers project areas like Hotel room booking prediction, Virtual guide, and tourist
              place identifies and entertainment sector. Prediction help to hotel owner make sure to ready for
              each month. This given to option found suitable accommodation for tourist budget. Virtual guide done
              through the image process technology. it is most important feature because normally tourist not
              comfortable with unknown tourist guide with them so virtual guide will provide most comfortable and
              secure travelling to tourist. Place identify done through the image process technology. it will be
              providing identify unknown tourist place. Partly system cover entertainment perspective as well.
              System will provide image capture and share using argumentative reality.</p>

            <p>
              Nowadays tourism has become one of the major sources of Sri Lanka. There are many attractive tourist
              places cover the tourist but still they struggle to find the tourist places and tour guides. There are
              some drawbacks impacting the tourism industry. When tourist search some places, they don’t get any proper
              way to reach the destination and also they don’t get better information regarding the places what they
              searched. At the time they might skip those places.

            <h2 class="mb-5">Methodology </h2>
            <p>The process of the trip assistant system contains the sequences of process as follows. First, the user
              registers our application and we provide login change password delete account and more other basic
              options. All the register user details are stored in our main system and we save all those details with
              encrypted format.

            <p>
              A. Tourist place detection (TPD)<br>

              This functionality will detect tourist places in front of tourists or tourists place pictures they wish to
              identify, also it will give description about identified tourist place to the user as text output. This
              functionality will be developed through machine learning techniques and description data will be load from
              the firebase database. To achieve this functionality tourist places pictures are collected and trained an
              image classification machine learning model to predict the tourist places. The user can take pictures of
              tourist places in whatever the angle, so the tourist place detection component is developed to identify
              the tourist places in whatever the angle.

            <p>
              B. Virtual guide<br>

              This is a Real-time process and it is identifying the elements of the tourist places offered by the
              application and it is providing real-time information and voice-activated information. Image processing
              and Machine learning plays key aspects in this. Considering the application size, the data needed for this
              virtual guide will be obtained from time to time from the cloud database. User can get information in any
              vies or angles so that will provide a comfortable user experience. There are some issues in this virtual
              guide function. Any changes in the surrounding or any changes in the actual state of the element and
              lighting conditions might cause trouble in identifying it properly. This function is highly depending on
              both the processing speed and network speed.<br><br>
              The specific goals of the virtual guide functionality are given below.<br>
              1.Recognizing important element in real-time while the user is moving around with the virtual guide
              feature turned on, in service offered tourist locations in any position or angles.<br>
              2.Providing real-time information about recognized tourist elements both as text and voice-activated
              outputs to the user.<br>
              3.Providing timely alerts for the user for avoiding the tourist run out of time by spending more time in a
              place than allocated.<br>

              The hotels will use web interface to register their hotels and using web portal hotels can manage all the
              booking related activities. Using our booking prediction facility, hotels can see the number of bookings

              D. 3D map with augmented reality<br>

              Augmented reality is the technology that improves our world by adding some digital information on it.
              Tourist guide map is very important for the tourist they can find the places through the maps. In this
              research, we create a 3D map using augmented reality. Through this 3D map function, users can view their
              actual location with the 3D view and users can get this map on any other surface. This application is the
              real-time application and its get a user’s location from the phone GPS. This application used unity C# and
              the map box for that develop purposes.
