            <h2 class="mb-5">BACKGROUND STUDY</h2>
            <p>We did an inside Literature survey on already existing security measures and the inside architecture of
              Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connectivity, Rogue access point detection, Data leakage prevention and Wi-Fi direct. The
              outcome of our in-depth search for the knowledge of underlying technologies and their security levels as
              follow</p>
            <p><strong>I. Data Leakage prevention</strong><br>
              There have been several researches conducted on the topic of data leakage and its prevention. Even though
              there are no much researches done on accidental data leakage to unauthorized parties, general concept of
              data leakage prevention has been discussed widely. Most of them are industrial level standards.
            </p>
            <p>A. Detecting Data semantic: A data leakage prevention approach <br>
              The leakage of sensitive files and data to outsiders can be a disastrous thing for a multinational
              organization or to an individual. The leakage in data such as trade secret, company banking details,
              individual ID numbers and health records can affect the stake of a company, the privacy of an individual
              and the security of the assets.
              <div class="col-md-12">
                  <img src="images/BS/dlp.png" alt="Smiley face" style="margin: auto; display:block;">
              </div>

              In this DLP model they use statistical data analysis to identify the sensitive data semantics. They use a
              very famous weighting function Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) which is used to
              retrieval of information and text mining to measure the amount of information in a document or a file.
              They are aiming to separate the details in the document according to pre-defined topics which has a
              predefined secrecy level. And once the detected, it can be blocked, quarantined or alerted according to
              the predefined set of instructions. And they propose to implement the DLP as a hardware appliance or a
              software agent which can be installed in the clients Device.</p>
            <p>B. Automatic detection of sensitive attribute in PPDM <br>
              Here they propose to suppress the sensitive data by data mining in order to prevent it from being leaked.
              They propose to do the data mining to find out the sensitive attributes in a database and hide the values
              in order to protect the privacy.
              First client query is thoroughly analyzed to find out the sensitive attributes. Attributes can be defined
              as sensitive with regards to the previously defined threshold value by the data owner. When considering a
              database sensitivity weight will be assigned to every attribute and the query will be analyzed for the
              total sensitivity value. If the total of the sensitivity of the required attributes exceed the threshold
              it will carry out the operations which were pre-defined. By this method they propose to eliminate the
              accidental leakage of sensitive data from a database to an outside unauthorized party.</p>
            <p>C. Sensitive data leakage detection in pre-installed applications of custom Android firmware. <br>

              In this research study they came up with a sensitive information leakage analysis system for android based
              devices by analyzing the over 290 custom ROMs which are already existing. The system has three main
              modules.<br>
              • APK extractor: - This extractor helps to extract the pre-installed applications from the custom ROMs. To
              extract, a batch script is being used to get all the applications which can be pre-installed in any
              formats such as zip.<br>
              • APK analyzer: - This particular module first analyzes every extracted application for sensitive paths
              and their entry and exit points. It checks the entry point and exit point in order to be used by the path
              matcher later. And also, this APK analyzer analyze the data flow of each applications and filter out the
              flows that relates to sensitive sources and critical sinks. These source-sink methods help to find out the
              actual sensitive data.<br>
              • Path Matcher: - In this module path matcher builds all the possible links for the entry points and exit
              points which were found by APK Analyzer to detect the availability of data leakage in the flow. These
              flows can be present anywhere.<br>
              As a result of these research they found 4 out of 290 custom ROMs had data leakage in the pre-installed
              system applications.

            <p><strong>II.Rogue access point detection</strong><br>

              A. Active User-side Evil Twin Access Point Detection Using Statistical Techniques (TMM, HDT). <br>

              This research proposes a new lightweight end user based evil twin detection solution. This technique does
              not rely on fingerprint checking of suspect devices nor require a known authorized AP/host list. Thus,
              this solution is most beneficial
              for user who are in the move or has high mobility outside the organization.<br>

              This research focuses mainly on accomplishing most from Intrinsic communication and to identify the
              properties of the evil twin attacks. Furthermore, we propose two statistical anomaly detection algorithms
              for evil twin detection that is Trained Mean Matching (TMM)and Hop Differentiating Technique (HDT). In
              particular, our HDT improves TMM by removing the training requirement. HDT is resistant to the environment
              change such as network saturation and RSSI fluctuation.
            </p>
            <p>B. CETAD: Detecting Evil Twin Access Point Attacks in Wireless Hotspots <br>

              In this paper, we propose a mechanism CETAD leveraging public servers to detect such attacks. CETAD only
              requires installing an app at the client device and does not require to change the hotspot APs. CETAD
              explores the similarities between the legitimate APs and discrepancies between evil twin APs, and
              legitimate ones to detect an evil twin AP attack. Through our implementation and evaluation, we show that
              CETAD can detect evil twin AP attacks in various scenarios effectively. As most of the most solutions are
              designed for infrastructure network rather than for client devices. This research mainly focuses on
              developing a solution on client side. Thus, this research focus on designing a plug-and-play mechanism to
              detect evil twin AP attacks that only requires to install software at the client device.<br>

              There are many challenges that has to be faced when designing a client-side mechanism to detect evil twin
              AP attacks. First, the client has no information or access about the hotspot architecture as it has only
              limited resources. Second, many scenarios have to be considered while developing as all the hotspots use
              various Wi-Fi setup. Third, adding custom hardware, e.g., routers or servers, is not an option as it would
              limit the applicability and universal acceptance. We overcome these challenges and design a detection
              mechanism that we call CETAD (Client end Evil Twin Access point Detector).<br>

              When multiple AP’s connect to the same ISP when they are legally configured to form a hotspot. Thus, they
              share same SSID and similar network parameters such as ISP names, Global IP address, Round trip timer,
              temporal network behavior. But a evil twin AP will use a different network setup. This research mainly
              focuses on these parameters to identify whether the APs belong to same group or not. Even though CETAD is
              designed for client devices, it can be extended to detect evil twin APs in an infrastructure network as
              well.
            </p>
            <p>C. A Hidden Markov Model Based Approach to Detect Rogue Access Points  <br>
              This research focuses on using Hidden Markov Model to detect the Rogue Access Points in a WLAN. This
              approach identifies a RAP by observing the traffic characteristics of the end hosts in a network. Hidden
              Markov Model represents the probability of transitions between the different security states of an access
              point. HMM functions as follows, HMM is trained based on some training data set which consists of
              information obtained from related to packet traces. These packet traces are gleaned from traffic which
              includes normal internet activities.<br>
              Once the HMM is trained different traffics are monitored in the end user side. By observing the inter
              arrival time of the packets HMM decides whether an access point is authorized or not.

            <p><strong> III. SECURE BLUETOOTH</strong><br>
              A. Bluetooth Security Protocol Stacks<br>
              Protocol stacks are defined as the combination and implementation of security protocols of
              hardware/software. Protocol stacks defines the connectivity between devices according to the standards.
              <br>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                  <img src="images/BS/bt.png" alt="Smiley face" style="margin: auto; display:block;">
              </div>

              OBEX- Object Exchange Protocol used to transfer objects such as files, contacts and calendars as
              client-server model.<br>
              SDP- Service Discovery Protocol discovers all the services that are around the RF range proximity and it
              validate the characteristics of the available discoverable device services.
              The above-mentioned protocols are limited to some security extends according to their requirements. We are
              proposing a solution for the protocol stacks with an overall security of the inbound and outbound
              connectivity of the Bluetooth technologies by implanting a firewall which will contain the below stated
              features,<br>
              • Considering all the protocols in Bluetooth channels which will monitor and filter the inbound traffic
              for malicious packets with signature and behavioral based detections.<br>
              • Alerting the user for malicious behaviors of incoming files and automatically quarantine them.<br>
              • User confirmation will be granted for the particular device to permanently block the attacker device
              from being connected again<br>
              • Logs all Bluetooth events.<br>
              • We have the choice to decide on the trusted remote devices.<br>
              • Ability to validate the device types with the Bluetooth addresses.
            </p>
            <p>B. Bluetooth Improved Link Key Generation<br>
              Several protection measures have been implemented at one of a kind protocol degree, however the safety of
              the protocols depends on the configuration of the user’s device according to their decision of Turing one
              the discoverable and connectivity options. We can divide the discoverability and connectivity into three
              modes of operations for the security purposes,<br>

              Silent: In this more only the traffics will be monitored and no data connection will be accepted.
              Private: According to this mode the device will be only discoverable for the devices which is already
              having the Bluetooth device address of the requested device. The Bluetooth device address is unique for
              the particular device.<br>
              Public: It is a discoverable device which is open for connectivity.<br>
              <div class="col-md-12">
                  <img src="images/BS/bt1.png" alt="Smiley face" style="margin: auto; display:block;">
              </div>

              By discovering the unit key of the devices Man-in-the-Middle attack is possible. According to the
              researcher perspective the two devices connected with the unit key has to enter the PIN for the
              authentication purposes, considering that the file traffic will have a secure connection with the aid of
              Keyed Hash Function/Algorithm. The is known to the specific devices which is considered as Link Key by
              them. Then the Link key will go through the Keyed Hash Algorithm and PIN will be combined as E3 algorithm
              to obtain the Encryption key. The PIN also know to the only the connected devices so the untrusted and
              fake devices can be eliminated and cannot generate the Encryption Key for accessing the devices the each
              other. By this process the Man-in-the-Middle attack will be eliminated according the researcher’s
              perspective. <br>
              This paper proposes the encryption architecture of the Bluetooth key management technique, with above
              mentioned PIN encryption method and by validating the Bluetooth addresses with the aid of the embedded
              inbuilt Bluetooth firewall technology. Bluetooth addresses which is displayed in as 6 bytes and written in
              hexadecimal format and separated with colons. It will eliminate fake devices more accurately than previous
              method and the Man-in-the-Middle attack will be failed to exploit for the attacker.
              NAP- Non-significant Address Part value is used in Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) frames.
              UAP- Upper Address Part value is used for seeding the various Bluetooth specification algorithms.
              LAP- Lower Address Part value uniquely finds a Bluetooth device as part of the Access Code in all
              transmitted traffics.<br>
              OUI- Organizationally Unique Identifier<br>

              There is an open source tool available for Bluetooth address lookup which provide the information of the
              vendor, the device type and manufacturing details. The tool can used by inputting the Bluetooth addresses.
              Our study will sum up by embedding this information gathering tool with the address of Bluetooth, which
              will be added alongside with our Bluetooth firewall technology for validating the device details and
              logging purposes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>IV. Secure Wi-Fi Direct</strong><br>

              There have been no many researches done regarding the security issues of peer-to-peer technology
              connection and contingencies done. Some of the similar research topics and their abstracts are below.<br>

              A. Secure Device-to-Device Communications over Wi-Fi Direct- A Short-Authentication-String-Based Key
              Agreement Protocol <br>
              This research mainly focused on designing protocol for pair wise key agreement to involve minimal mutual
              authentication or human interaction. This protocol basically provides an ideal security level in regarding
              to the required bits that must be mutually authenticated.<br>
              Short Authentication based key agreement protocol utilizes a cryptography commitment scheme. This
              commitment scheme allows to hide a chosen value through a single commit action. Any device which obtains
              the pair of value is able to reveal the committed value via an open operation. This commitment value
              doesn't leak any information about the hidden value. This cryptographic function helps to achieve an
              efficient commitment scheme.<br>
              The main goal of this research is to implement an Android application by involving Secure Key
              establishment functionality into a conventional Wi-Fi Direct application. This solution would allow the
              user to establish pairwise secret keys which can be used to encrypt the data transmitted through Wi-Fi
              direct connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              B. Wi-Fi protected Service (WPS) <br>

              Wi-Fi Direct devices are required to implement Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) to support a secure connection
              with minimal user intervention. In particular, WPS allows to establish a secure connection by introducing
              a PIN in the P2P Client or pushing a button in the two P2P Devices. Following WPS terminology, the P2P GO
              is required to implement an internal Registrar, and the P2P Client is required to implement an Enrollee.
              The operation of WPS is composed of two parts. The first part which is referred as “Phase 1”, the internal
              Registrar is in charge of generating and issuing the network credentials such as security keys, to the
              Enrollee. WPS is based on WPA-2 security and uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-CCMP as cypher, and a
              randomly generated PreShared Key (PSK) for mutual authentication. The second part, denoted as “Phase 2”,
              the Enrollee (P2P Client) disassociates and reconnects using its new authentication credentials. In this
              way, if two devices already have the required network credentials (this is the case in the Persistent
              group formation), there is no need to trigger the first phase, and they can directly perform the
              authentication.

            <p>
                Nowadays tourism has become one of the major sources of Sri Lanka. There are many attractive tourist places cover the tourist but still they struggle to find the tourist places and tour guides.  There are some drawbacks impacting the tourism industry. When tourist search some places, they don’t get any proper way to reach the destination and also they don’t get better information regarding the places what they searched. At the time they might skip those places.

            <p>The process of the trip assistant system contains the sequences of process as follows. First, the user registers our application and we provide login change password delete account and more other basic options. All the register user details are stored in our main system and we save all those details with encrypted format.

              A. Tourist place detection (TPD)<br>

              This functionality will detect tourist places in front of tourists or tourists place pictures they wish to identify, also it will give description about identified tourist place to the user as text output. This functionality will be developed through machine learning techniques and description data will be load from the firebase database. To achieve this functionality tourist places pictures are collected and trained an image classification machine learning model to predict the tourist places. The user can take pictures of tourist places in whatever the angle, so the tourist place detection component is developed to identify the tourist places in whatever the angle.

                B. Virtual guide<br>
  
                This is a Real-time process and it is identifying the elements of the tourist places offered by the application and it is providing real-time information and voice-activated information. Image processing and Machine learning plays key aspects in this. Considering the application size, the data needed for this virtual guide will be obtained from time to time from the cloud database.  User can get information in any vies or angles so that will provide a comfortable user experience. There are some issues in this virtual guide function. Any changes in the surrounding or any changes in the actual state of the element and lighting conditions might cause trouble in identifying it properly. This function is highly depending on both the processing speed and network speed.<br><br>
                The specific goals of the virtual guide functionality are given below.<br>
                   1.Recognizing important element in real-time while the user is moving around with the virtual guide feature turned on, in service offered tourist locations in any position or angles.<br>
                   2.Providing real-time information about recognized tourist elements both as text and voice-activated outputs to the user.<br>
                   3.Providing timely alerts for the user for avoiding the tourist run out of time by spending more time in a place than allocated.<br>

                      Augmented reality is the technology that improves our world by adding some digital information on it. Tourist guide map is very important for the tourist they can find the places through the maps. In this research, we create a 3D map using augmented reality. Through this 3D map function, users can view their actual location with the 3D view and users can get this map on any other surface. This application is the real-time application and its get a user’s location from the phone GPS. This application used unity C# and the map box for that develop purposes.
